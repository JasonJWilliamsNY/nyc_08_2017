## Some other tips

### Transportation
**Subway**
Nearly everywhere you want to go is accessible via Subway, which runs 24 hours
and is relatively cheap. Consider getting an [unlimited 7-day pass](http://web.mta.info/nyct/fare/FaresatAGlance.htm); you can buy Metrocards
at machines at every subway station. Your smart phone will undoubtedly have
apps that will help you plan your trip and give you updated times. See also [http://www.mta.info/](http://www.mta.info/).

**Taxi/Uber/Bus**
Taxis are available nearly everywhere in Manhattan, but may be harder to find
outside of Manhattan. They have highly regulated fares. There are also Apps
available to help you hail a cab. Uber also has extensive coverage, and may be
good in a pinch, especially in the other boroughs. Near tourist attractions such
as the Empire State Building, there will be hop-on/hop-off busses.

## Safety
NYC is the US's safest large city. Like any place, there are bad spots especially
at night. Most of Manhattan is fine 24 hours. The Bronx, and part of Brooklyn and
Queens are lest frequented by tourists. As a result, its easier to stick out and
be targeted. NYC is very diverse. If you don't look like a tourist (cameras, maps)
you can fit in easily. Also, in the more touristy sections, there are lots of
people looking to sell you stuff. Somethings may be scams, but mostly they are
pushy.

## Outer Boroughs
Most tourist attractions focus on Manhattan, but there are lots of things in the
other boroughs and on Long Island. There are three active Chinatowns in NYC, and
[Flushing, Queens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens) is the largest.
Downtown Brooklyn, is becoming trendy, and the Bronx has NYC's largest park (Pelham
Bay). Ask if you have questions, because again some areas may be less safe. Long
Island has world-class beaches ([Jone's Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_Beach_State_Park)) and
wineries.

## Shopping
There is no shortage of shopping, from Macy's on 35th to 5th Ave. All depends on
how much money you want to spend.
